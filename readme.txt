===Sky Flyer===
The Allen Soilders Defualt Rocket Ship


===Wing===
A weird looking machine that was swpied from the aliens


===RAA Ship===
This was also swpied from the aliens. What can I say their technology is simply mesmorising


===Spyder===
Created by Narvoc and given to Gallo as a 'thank you' for his assistance in protecting his temple


===Gladiator===
Fully Armored but slow in movement. This rocket was also taken from the aliens and packs a punch but cannot launch missles.

===Drone1===
Drone 1 is a prototype or experiment by General Gallo's scientists. The idea for this ship was gotten from the technology of the alisn ships it's still weak tho.


===Glider===
Honestly IDK what this is.


===TOMA===
One of the most powerful ships ever created by Narvoc. Gaining up to 1500 HP this Monster can soak up damage and dishes out some too. One could say it's General Gallo's best friend.
